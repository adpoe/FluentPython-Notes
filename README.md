# FluentPython-Notes
Notes written while reading Fluent Python, and generally experimenting with aspects of the language.

All open source. If you find something useful, feel free to incorporate it into your own project.

Most of this is from Fluent Python. Other sources also represented, and noted when that is the case.

All in all, this is work done for my own experimentation over time; not related to a concrete single project.
